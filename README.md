# Rubik-s-Cube
A virtual rubik's cube with the ability to solve, get a tutorial. Made in python.

2/3 Figuring out how to represent cube tiles

2/7 Created a 3d representation of a cube with a 3d matrix containing text for corner, edge, center, and core

2/14 Fixed a bug where tiles added to the list automatically changed color and rotation

2/15 Re-added the rotation vectors to each piece so it will know how to rotate each piece in the 3d gui. Can't confirm until the 3d gui is built

2/17 Added the ability to obtain a layer on the puzzle (This is not a side) Also can rotate the Right side Clockwise

3/2 Now Can get sides and rotate them, but doesn't affect original matrix
